								 only when you breathe or stretch your neck.Thyroid glands <br>
								 secrete hormones which help to regulate and regulate the body. <br>
								 Thyroid hormones regulate the gland and the body. Thyroid <br>
 								hormones are often used for a variety of different purposes such as <br>
 								regulating metabolism, control the growth and development of the body, <br>

							<b>Prevention</b><br>
Since most common problems related to thyroid are associated with age, it <br>
is possible to treat them at any age. Most problems related to thyroid are <br>
due to a condition of which the thyroid gland is producing too much or not <br>
enough hormones. Some of the common ones are: hypothyroidism, hyperthyroidism, <br>
thyroiditis, parathyroid tumors, an autoimmune disease, etc. Treatment Thyroid<br>
 surgeries can be very helpful in curing most of the thyroid problems. But if <br>
 the problem is very severe, then thyroid injections may be considered. In a <br>
 study, it was found that low dose thyrotropin-releasing hormone analog (LTRH) <br>
 has the best anti-thyroid effect, but it's known that too much injection may <br>
 result in the same.<br><br>

<br><br>	<b>	Conclusion</b><br>
"We've lost count of the number of calls from sick people who said their <br>
hair was falling out in clumps and they had shaking hands. The majority <br>
of these people had previously been in good health and, quite surprisingly, <br>
they were all diagnosed with hypothyroidism." - Dr Dawn Harper, Medical <br>
director at Thyroid UK Thyroid disease or hypothyroidism is a condition that<br>
 is very common in the world today and is usually diagnosed in an adult aged <br>
 between 30 and 50. It is a disease characterized by low thyroid hormone level. <br>
 Though, it can be observed in children, elderly people and women too. Even if <br>
 thyroids don't show symptoms, it can damage vital organs. What Is Thyroid Disorder? <br>
 It is a chronic disease which causes lack of thyroid hormone and hence helps to <br>
 produce enough.<br>
